<h1>Vulnerability Assessment Report</h1><br>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.
<br><br>A vulnerability assessment of the situation can help you communicate the potential risks with decision-makers at the company. You must create a written report that clearly explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.


<h3>System Description</h3>
The server hardware is equipped with a robust CPU processor and boasts 128GB of memory capacity. Operating on the most recent version of the Linux operating system, it serves as a host for a MySQL database management system. The server is configured to maintain a reliable network connection using IPv4 addresses and engages in interactions with other servers within the network. Notably, security protocols are in place to enforce SSL/TLS encrypted connections, ensuring a heightened level of data security during communication and transactions.

<h3>Scope</h3>
The vulnerability assessment focuses on evaluating the existing access controls implemented within the system. This assessment will span a duration of three months, specifically from June 20XX to August 20XX. The risk analysis of the information system will adhere to guidelines outlined in NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1, serving as the framework for conducting the assessment and identifying potential vulnerabilities within the system's access controls.

<h3>Purpose</h3>
The database server functions as a centralised computing system responsible for storing and managing extensive volumes of data. This server plays a pivotal role in housing customer information, campaign data, and analytics, facilitating subsequent analysis for performance tracking and enabling tailored marketing initiatives. Securing this system is of paramount importance due to its frequent utilisation in supporting ongoing marketing operations.

<br><b>Risk: </b>3



<h3>Approach</h3>
The risk assessment took into account the data storage and management protocols of the business. Identifying potential threat sources and events involved assessing the likelihood of a security incident occurring based on the system's open access permissions. Evaluating the severity of potential incidents was conducted in conjunction with their impact on the day-to-day operational requirements of the organisation.

<h3>Remediation Strategy</h3>
The measures encompass the implementation of robust authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms to safeguard the database server, ensuring access is granted solely to authorised users. This involves employing stringent password policies, employing role-based access controls, and integrating multi-factor authentication to restrict user privileges effectively. Additionally, data in transit will be encrypted using TLS (Transport Layer Security) instead of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to bolster security. Furthermore, IP allow-listing will be enforced to exclusively permit access from corporate offices, thereby preventing unauthorised external users from connecting to the database server.
